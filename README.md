# The Analysis


Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

``` SQL
SELECT
    job_postings_fact.job_id,
    Job_title,
    job_title_short ,
    job_location,
    Job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name as Company_name

FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
WHERE
    (job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' or job_title_short like '%Scien%')
    AND
    job_location='Anywhere' 
    AND
    salary_year_avg is not NULL
GROUP BY job_postings_fact.job_id ,company_dim.name
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

Conclusion:
1. Top-paying roles: Positions like Staff Data Scientist/Quant Researcher and Senior Data Scientist offer salaries ranging from $288,000 to $550,000, with the highest compensation found in finance and business analytics.
